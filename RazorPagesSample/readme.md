# About

A super simple Razor Pages sample that demonstrates how to use hash passwords in a database via NuGet package [BCrypt.Net-Next](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BCrypt.Net-Next/4.0.3?_src=template) using EF Core 8.

:heavy_check_mark: No controllers used to keep the code simple.


## IMPORTANT

This application needs `EF_Core_ValueConversionsEncryptProperty` project to run first to create the database and table with one entry.
